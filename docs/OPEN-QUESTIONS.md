# Open Questions

Append-only log of spec ambiguities encountered during implementation, and
their resolutions. Entries are dated and never edited or deleted. A
decision is changed by appending a new, superseding entry that references
the entry it supersedes — never by editing history.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

**Context:** what was ambiguous and where (spec section, file).
**Recommendation:** the safe default proposed, if any.
**Ruling:** human decision, or "pending" until one is made.
**Supersedes:** (optional) link/reference to the prior entry this replaces.

## 2026-08-28 — Software licence: Apache-2.0

**Context:** `docs/omgp-spec-v0.7.md` §50 "Licensing Direction" says
licensing "remains to be formally selected" (Apache-2.0 or MIT plausible
for software), while `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` §4b and constitution Principle
VIII state Apache-2.0. The committed `LICENSE` file contained no licence
text at all — only a sandbox network-egress error message captured when
an earlier fetch of the Apache-2.0 text failed — so no licence was
actually granted for this public repository.
**Recommendation:** Apache-2.0, as already stated by the constitution and
GOVERNANCE.md; replace `LICENSE` with the canonical text.
**Ruling:** Apache-2.0 — human instruction 2026-08-28. `LICENSE` replaced
with the canonical Apache License 2.0 text (sourced from the system
licence store, not the network). Spec §50 should be updated to record the
decision; the spec is a human-ruling artefact, so that edit is left to a
human.
**Supersedes:** none.

## 2026-08-28 — L3 response payload layouts (IDENTIFY, READ_DESC, GET_PARAM, GET_EVENT)

**Context:** `docs/protocol-l3.md` §3.1 describes these four responses in
prose only ("Returns protocol version, module type, descriptor length,
descriptor CRC-16"; "response carries value"; etc.) with no field widths
or order. Feature `specs/001-protocol-foundation` (FR-008) cannot encode
them faithfully without a fixed layout.
**Recommendation:** adopt concrete provisional layouts, little-endian per
§4 convention: IDENTIFY = u8 major, u8 minor, u8 module_type, u16
desc_len, u16 desc_crc; READ_DESC = u16 offset (echo), u8 len, u8[len];
GET_PARAM = u8 param_id, u8 scope, u16 value; GET_EVENT = u8 event_type,
u8 remaining_count, u8[] detail. Add them to `protocol/omgp-protocol.yaml`
and the §3.1 table in the same (T3, CODEOWNERS-reviewed) change.
**Ruling:** adopted as recommended — human, 2026-08-28. Provisional: the
GET_EVENT layout may be revisited when protocol-l3.md §6.4 (drain multiple
events per call?) is settled; that would be a superseding entry here.
**Supersedes:** none.

## 2026-08-28 — Backplane opcode payloads (BP_SLOT_MAP, BP_POWER, BP_ROUTE)

**Context:** `docs/protocol-l3.md` §3.1 gives BP_SLOT_MAP and BP_POWER in
prose only and marks BP_ROUTE "format TBD with routing hardware"; §6.1
questions whether BP_ROUTE belongs at L3 at all. Feature
`specs/001-protocol-foundation` (FR-009) must still exercise the opcode
dispatch path for every v1 opcode.
**Recommendation:** opaque passthrough — header codec plus verbatim
payload bytes, no field-level validation — so a future field-level codec
is a purely additive change with no wire-format break.
**Ruling:** adopted as recommended — human, 2026-08-28. Field-level
layouts remain open pending backplane hardware design (slot count, rail
set) and the §6.1 decision; expect a superseding entry per opcode.
**Supersedes:** none.

## 2026-08-28 — Test-only dependencies for feature 001 (test framework, mutation tool)

**Context:** GOVERNANCE.md §1 makes any new dependency a human decision
and OPERATING-POLICY §2 forbids agents introducing one without a
`needs-human` ruling. Feature `specs/001-protocol-foundation` needs a
C++ unit-test framework for a large codec suite and a mutation-testing
tool so the CI `deep-verify` job can fail (both stubs currently exit 0).
The alternative (hand-rolled harness + repo-local mutator) was offered.
**Recommendation:** no new dependencies (repo-local tooling).
**Ruling:** the recommendation was NOT adopted. Human, 2026-08-28: one
C++ test framework and one mutation-testing tool are approved, on
condition that each is open-source under an Apache-2.0-compatible
licence, pinned to an exact version, builds offline (vendored or
equivalent), and never becomes a host-core dependency. Specific tool
selection is delegated to the feature plan; introduction lands as its own
T2 slice (spec FR-032). Adopting a framework must keep the pipeline's
executed-check floor working (spec FR-033).
**Supersedes:** none.

## 2026-08-28 — Descriptor CRC-16 variant and scope (IDENTIFY desc_crc)

**Context:** `docs/protocol-l3.md` §3.1 says IDENTIFY returns a
"descriptor CRC-16" and §4.1 uses it for descriptor caching, but neither
names the CRC variant nor the bytes it covers. `protocol/omgp-protocol.yaml`
records `link_trunk.crc: crc16_ccitt_false` for trunk frames only.
**Recommendation:** CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE over the entire descriptor blob
exactly as served by READ_DESC — reuses the trunk's variant, for which a
C++ helper and Python reference already exist and are differentially
tested; record the variant in the YAML under the descriptor limits.
**Ruling:** adopted as recommended — human, 2026-08-28. Feature 001
provides `descriptor_crc()` in both implementations (spec FR-034); the
YAML/docs update travels with the FR-008 T3 slice.
**Supersedes:** none.

## 2026-08-28 — Protocol version after pre-release YAML additions

**Context:** feature 001 adds response layouts and the descriptor CRC
variant to `protocol/omgp-protocol.yaml`. `docs/protocol-l3.md` §4.2 says
minor versions are purely additive, but is silent on whether pre-release
draft completion counts as a version-worthy change.
**Recommendation:** stay at 1.0 — the draft ("provisional until exercised
by the virtual bus") is being completed, not extended; no deployed module
can observe the change.
**Ruling:** adopted as recommended — human, 2026-08-28. Minor-version
discipline begins at the first tagged protocol release; until then,
definition-file changes do not bump `protocol.minor`.
**Supersedes:** none.
